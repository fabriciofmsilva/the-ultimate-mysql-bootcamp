# Tables

The true heart of SQL

A database is just a bunch of tables, in the relational database, at least

Tables hold the data, a collection of related data held in a structured format within a database

The cats table

| Name | Breed | Age |
| :--: | :---: | :-: |
| Blue | Scottish Fold | 1 |
| Rocket | Persian | 3 |

Columns (headers)

Rows (the actual data)

Databases are made up of lots of tables.
