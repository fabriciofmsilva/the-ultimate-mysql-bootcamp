# MySQL - Why Databases Are Awesome

What Is A Database?

Why Do They Matter?

1. A collection of data
2. A method for accessing and manipulating that data

Ex. Phone book

Database Management System

A structured set of computerized data with an accessible interface

Let's Start With SQL
Structured Query Language

SQL is the language we use to "talk" to our databases

Two Takeaways

1. Once you learn SQL, it's pretty easy to switch to another DB that uses SQL
2. What makes databases (DBMS) unique are the features they offer, not the language
